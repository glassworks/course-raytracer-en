# And many other challenges

Now that you know the basics, it's up to you to put them together and create your ray tracer.

But you will face many other algorithmic and organizational challenges:

- How will you represent your mathematical constructs (vectors, colors, etc.)?
- What data structure will you use to represent your scene?
- When you launch a ray, how will you calculate which object(s) the ray intersects, and which one to use for your pixel?
- Try to determine the computational complexity of your raytracer. Are there ways to optimize it?
